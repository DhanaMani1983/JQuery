JQuery Introduction
#############################################

JQuery:

Javascript is powerful, but coding is very tedious. To make scripting easier and less tedious JQuery was introduced

Browser Compatibility:

Javascript coding differed for each browser, to have common functions and scipts across all browser.

Ease of work:

Javascript was able to handle only one element at a time where Jquery can select group of elements apply function or styles

Utilities:

To perform certain functionalities utilities are available

Plug-ins:

For example: to provide auto-complete functionality for textbox plug-ins are available

Working with Ajax is important in this era


Jquery Integration:

To use Jquery in your website, you need to download Jquery

jQuery.com/download then download the compressed production Jquery

Linking to web page:

Include the jquery min file as 

<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery1.js"></script>

$(document).ready(
	function(){
		alert("Message from JQuery!!");
	}	
);

$ marks start of Jquery
value within () is selector, above document is selector
ready means document completed loading, similar to window.onload

DOM and DocumentLoad:

Javascript is used for HTML manipulation, but how text can be manipulated. Browser sees HTML document as DOM, where each tag is considered as object where each attribute is a property
Becuase each element is a object we can use it properties and methods easily. 
<html><head></head><body></body></html> where html has 2 object, head will have own set of objects and body will have own set of objects.

On Document Load:

If we want to modify DOM, we need to wait for browser to download the document from server and convert it to DOM. If we manpulate before dom we might get error. 

So it best wait till document gets loaded.$(document).ready checks/waits till document gets loaded. shortcut for it is $(function(){};);

JQuery Operations:

In JQuery one can do multiple operations but most of the time we will be doing the following, refer example for more detail understanding

Selection

To select an element use CSS notation like #Elementname

Getting/Setting Content

To get value from an element use val() function and use html() function to set value for the element 

Getting/Setting Style

Simple Interest:

Designing Form
Assigning Ids
Hooking up click event of Button
Displaying output

Please refer training demos

Temperature Conversion Chart:

Input Controls

Output Para

Contruct table and assign to para
